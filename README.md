# AzureStaticWebApps-ComicBook

A developer has been tasked by his professor to update the website for an upcoming seminar, migrating to the cloud and automating deployment (Probably a similar situation that most of us can relate to!)

He struggles but fortunately for him, Sophia, his friend, appears and explains to him how he can publish his site without having to write code, or connect with tokens, or write a yaml. He can now do it with any framework - from Angular, React and Vue.js.

Read more about how he easily solves his problem with Azure Static Web apps.
